## Why this Workshop?

In modern cloud environments, keeping costs under control is essential for any team or organization. One common reason for unexpected AWS charges is stale or forgotten resources — especially EC2 snapshots, Elastic IPs, and unattached volumes that accumulate silently and generate monthly costs.

This workshop demonstrates a simple but practical approach to detect and automatically clean up unused Amazon EC2 snapshots using a smart AWS Lambda function. By implementing this solution, you can reduce wasted spending and improve your team’s operational discipline.

## What Will You Learn?

- Understand how unnecessary EC2 snapshots and Elastic IPs can impact your AWS bill.
- Learn to navigate the EC2, Lambda, IAM, and CloudWatch consoles effectively.
- Create and configure a Lambda function to identify stale resources.
- Set up IAM policies for secure automation.
- Use CloudWatch or EventBridge to schedule regular cleanup tasks.
- Test the solution by creating, using, and then terminating resources to see the automated cleanup in action.

## Who Is This For?

This workshop is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, cloud administrators, or anyone who wants hands-on experience in controlling AWS storage costs through automation.

## Outcomes

By the end of this workshop, you will have:
- A functional automated cleanup solution deployed.
- Practical knowledge to adapt the same logic for other stale AWS resources.
- More awareness of how to monitor and manage your AWS cost more efficiently.

Let’s get started on making your cloud usage smarter and more cost-effective!
