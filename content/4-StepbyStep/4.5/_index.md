# Step 4.5: Automate with CloudWatch/EventBridge

#### Why It Matters

Automating the Lambda function with CloudWatch/EventBridge ensures regular cleanup of stale snapshots, but frequent invocations may increase costs. This step sets up a schedule to trigger the function periodically.

---

## Instructions

1. **Navigate to CloudWatch Console**:
   - From the AWS Console homepage, click **Services** â†’ **CloudWatch** to access the CloudWatch Console.

2. **Create a Rule**:
   - In the CloudWatch Console, click **Rules** in the left sidebar under **Events**.
   - Click **Create Rule**.
   - Select **Schedule** as the event source.
   - Configure the schedule:
     - Choose **Fixed rate** and set it to `1 hour` (e.g., `rate(1 hour)`).
   - Click **Add Target** and select **Lambda function**.
   - In the **Function** dropdown, choose `StaleSnapshotCleaner`.

3. **Configure Rule Details**:
   - Click **Next**.
   - In the **Targets** section, ensure the `StaleSnapshotCleaner` function is selected.
   - Click **Next** again.
   - For **Action after Schedule**, select **None**.

   ![CloudWatch Action None](../images/cloudwatch_action_none.png?featherlight=false&width=90pc)

4. **Finalize the Rule**:
   - Set the **Rule Name** to `HourlySnapshotCleanup`.
   - Click **Create Rule** to activate the schedule.

5. **Monitor Costs**:
   - The schedule triggers the Lambda function every hour, which may increase costs due to frequent executions.
   - Consider adjusting to a daily or weekly schedule (e.g., `rate(1 day)`) or triggering manually to optimize costs.
