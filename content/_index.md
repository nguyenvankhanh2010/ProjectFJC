# Building an effective AWS Cost Management system
This project provides a step-by-step guide to implementing an automated solution for managing and cleaning up EBS snapshots on AWS, aimed at optimizing S3 storage costs. By leveraging AWS Lambda to detect and delete snapshots not associated with active volumes, combined with CloudWatch/EventBridge for periodic triggering and IAM for security, the project reduces unnecessary costs, enhances resource management efficiency, and offers a scalable foundation for other AWS optimization tasks.
